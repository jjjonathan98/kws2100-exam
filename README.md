# Description

In this project 3 of us students have created a web application that shows geographical content and features. Our start goals was to completely finish a project worth of the grade C and work our way up to a B grade with what time we had left but unfortunaly with time and technical problems with github we could not progress any further. We were on a good way but to decided to delete code that was not necessary anymore and focused on finished a clean and well done project worthy of a C grade.

The main reason why we were stuck and decided to fall back with deleting functional code was because the GEOjson file provided on kart.dsb.no was too big to commit and be usable for github pages. Most of the errors and problem solving we found was because of lack of memory.

# Installation

1. Clone repository https://github.com/kristiania-kws2100-2024/kws2100-exam-Atridox.git
2. Install dependencies using "npm install".
3. Start the application using "npm run dev".

# Usage

After running the application with "npm run dev" you can then open the website provided in the Terminal. On the website you will have a functional map with multiple checkboxes to show you different data sources in Norway.

# Dependencies

Most of the dependencies will be ready after running "npm install" in the Terminal, other than that we have been provided data from kart.dsb.no.

# Contribution

The way our group organized workload was the usage of github desktop, all 3 of us would work on the same project and only 1 of us would commit finished code that would be in the final project. However coming up on problems with github we choose to have 1 person working on the main project and the other 2 working on the same project without commiting. This way we would instead send our code to the first person to then they would paste in our code. We figured out this would be the best way to work around problems with github incase of losing data and code with the time limitations we had for this exam.

# Credits

Throughout this exam we have been using Canvas, Panapto and github practise has inspiration.
